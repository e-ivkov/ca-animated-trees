# ca-animated-trees
Evolving rules for 2D animation of trees with cellular automata

This is a university porject at the lab of AI for Game Development. It started as a project for ProcJam (https://itch.io/jam/procjam/rate/193773).

The idea of this project is to evolve rules for cellular automata that will be able to animate growth of the Minecraft trees (from the intial to the final step).
